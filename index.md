> Objectives and Research Topics/Areas
The primary aim of this interdisciplinary workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners to deliberate on technical and non-technical issues, and investigate uncharted challenges and solutions in the domains of Data Privacy and Data Analysis in Healthcare systems. In fact, privacy concerns at local sites holding large data may limit sharing of individual-level records, requiring new algorithmic methods to leverage distributed data while addressing diverse privacy needs. Knowledge discovery and clinical support methods based on emerging artificial intelligence methods require novel privacy frameworks to minimize privacy harm to patients contributing to the data. To address this urgent need, this workshop aims at collecting the most innovative state-of-the-art solutions to support privacy-protecting clinical data analysis.
Topics include, but are not limited to:
