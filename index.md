title: The 3rd Workshop on Data Privacy and Data Analysis in Healthcare Systems (DPDAHS)
description: In conjunction with the 2026 IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (IEEE ICHI 2026) <br> 1st - 4th June 2026 - Minneapolis, MN - USA
---


## Objectives and Research Topics/Areas

<div class="jt">
Large-scale multimodal data generated by modern healthcare systems coupled with advances in artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have the potential for advancing medical research and improving patient care. At the same time, leveraging these data effectively requires addressing a host of novel challenges, intersecting privacy, scalability, and usability issues.

This workshop aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners in health informatics to discuss state-of-the-art approaches, real-world applications, and open challenges that drive future directions in this field. All submissions should present original research and provide high-quality contributions toward the areas of Data Privacy and Data Analysis in Healthcare Systems.
</div>

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

**1. Privacy and Data Sharing**: investigating the challenges of maximizing data usability while safeguarding patient privacy in healthcare data/EHR analytics, precision medicine, and data integration

**2. Trustworthy AI systems**: examining the potential impacts of emerging AI models in biomedical applications, such as privacy risks and predictive bias; applications of AI in healthcare

**3. Decentralized Data Analysis**: exploring emerging techniques for leveraging data across multiple sites including but not limited to blockchain-based technology, federated learning and swarm learning

**4. Health Data Analysis Infrastructure**: including but not limited to methodologies and tools, visualization analytics, health management/repositories, and real-world  case studies
